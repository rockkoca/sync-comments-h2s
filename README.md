# sync-comments-h2s: Sync comments from header files to source code files

### This program can help people that wanted to sync all the method comments from .h to .cpp.
### I don't want to copy comments from .h to .cpp every time I changed something in the .h. 
### So, I wrote this program.

## If you want to write different comments in source file, this program does not help at all.
